	xx Get someone who's never been on it before to check it over

http://lso.ravewebmedia.co.uk/
	## High Priority
	x Hero loading time - mobile versions!
	x A link to the gamelan page: both (x) in pop out and (x) on page.
	x Mobile version - don't show empty rooms.
	-!! Content. Actual content.
	x Route name in headers.
	x Clearly label info as info

	## Mid Priority
	x Putting credits in the footer/// readme. Rave, me, Martyna (then Charles)

	## Low Priority
	- Have it on the hero so when you hover over a route it changes the background
	- Little stairs icons instead of x's

http://lso.ravewebmedia.co.uk/gamelan/
	## High Priority
	x Spell check.
	x Calung and the Reyong - are the wrong way up. It would be great if you could flip these around - the largest keys/pots are always on the left-hand side.
	x Also, were any pictures taken of the beaters or mallets/ceng ceng cymbals? It might be nice to add these to give a sense of how the instruments are played.
	x The only thing I noticed was having to scroll back up when I'd had a look at all the instruments

	## Mid Priority
	- Left/Right instruments. Martyna asked.
	
	## Low Priority
	- Hovering box: annoying.

	## High Priority
	x Remove percussion sample for now.
	x Social media share buttons: explore
	x As a quick FYI the ‘start / stop’ button doesn’t seem to go back to saying ‘start’ after you’ve used it once – you have to press ‘stop’ again to start it… bit odd.

	## Mid Priority
	x Tell James it supports mp3 now
	x Share functionality
	x Fancy header

	## Low Priority
	- Save functionality
	- I would also suggest a little tiny icon of the instrument next to its name in the list, to make the listing more interesting to look at and more visual.






### ARCHIVE

	x Notes are playable (finish putting them in)
	-- /After/ composition is done, then think about having the left/right instuments.
	x /After/ Fill in learn buttons (disable for now) (M)
	x Have a general introduction to the gamelan. (M - Z add space)
	x Put in pitch ref!! Larger the key = deeper the note

http://lso.ravewebmedia.co.uk/gamelan/compose/

	x Working with just UGAL and kempli (possibly cengceng and gong) notes. Site updated.
	-- MP3 files, and changing samples as and when needed
	-- Save / share functionality
	-/ Sample compositions
	x Toggle to -close/open
	x Reduce size  (Martyna)
	-/ Pairs
	x The composition site needs a similar LSO header to the Gamelan one, and the same footer. 
	- I would also suggest a little tiny icon of the instrument next to its name in the list, to make the listing more interesting to look at and more visual.
	- I think social sharing buttons would be great. People will want to share this because it's great, and we want them to do this too!

	x One thing I think we should have on the main site (and the Gamelan page) is the facility to click outside the opening tab and have it go away.
